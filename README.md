# Hello GUYS 🙋‍♂️  
>It's my first time using Git :v

* This repo just has some IT001's homework and my extremely 'amateur' code 😥
* I save here so I can look back and know how 'amateur' I used to be and of course It's just BETTER than I was 😁

# 
* Btw, after a couple of months, I'd improved a little bit I think so :v 
* I haven't used C++ for coding GUI, I prefer DSA more 😅
* Wanna see my last C++ code's style 🤔
